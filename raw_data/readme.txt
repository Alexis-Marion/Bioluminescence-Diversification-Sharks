This folder contains the raw data required to perform the macroevolutionary analyses employed in the research article by Marion et al., 2025 titled "Bioluminescence and repeated deep-sea colonisation shaped the diversification and body size evolution of squaliform sharks"

It contains the following files:

- Data_taxo_genus.tsv (data regarding the taxonomy of squaliform genera)
- Data_taxo_species.tsv (data regarding the taxonomy of squaliform species)
- Habitat_fossil_Genus.tsv (data regarding the habitat of squaliformes species)
- Squaliformes_posterior_distribution.tree (posterior tree distribution of 100 tree from Marion et al., 2024 including all sampled living squaliform)
- Multi_Squaliformes_fossil_posterior_distribution.tree (posterior tree distribution of 100 tree from Marion et al., 2024 including all sampled living squaliform and 12 extinct species)
- Squaliformes_extant.tree (consensus squaliform tree from Marion et al., 2024, including all all sampled living squaliform)
- Squaliformes_fossil.tree (consensus squaliform tree from Marion et al., 2024 including all sampled living squaliform and 12 extinct species)
- Trait_data_Squaliformes_Fossil.tsv (data regarding the taxonomy, habitat, biolumienscence, maximum body-size of all squaliform species included in this study)
